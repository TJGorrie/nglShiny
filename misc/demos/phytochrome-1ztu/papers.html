Light signals regulate a plethora of plant responses throughout their life cycle,
especially the red and far-red regions of the light spectrum perceived by the
phytochrome family of photoreceptors. However, the mechanisms by which
phytochromes regulate gene expression and downstream responses remain
elusive.

<p><p>Several recent studies have unraveled the details on how phytochromes
	 regulate photomorphogenesis. These include
	 <ul>
	   <li>the identification of E3 ligases that degrade PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF)
	     proteins, key negative regulators, in response to light,
	   <li> a better view of how phytochromes inhibit another key negative regulator, CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1(COP1),
	   <li> and an understanding of why plants evolved multiple negative regulators to repress	       photomorphogenesis in darkness.
	 </ul>

	 These advances will surely fuel future research on many unanswered questions that have
	 intrigued plantphotobiologists for decades.

     Phytochromes are photoreceptors that provide plants with circadian, seasonal, and positional
     information critical for the control of germination, seedling development, shade avoidance,
     reproduction, dormancy, and sleep movements.
     <p>
     <p> Phytochromes are unique among photoreceptors in their capacity to interconvert between a
     red-absorbing form (absorption maximum of ∼<b>660</b> nm) and a far-red absorbing form
     (absorption maximum of ∼<b>730</b> nm), which occur in a dynamic equilibrium within plant
     cells, corresponding to the proportions of red and far-red energy in ambient light. Because
     pigments in stems and leaves absorb wavelengths <b>below about 700 nm</b>, this provides plants
     with an elegant system for detecting their position relative to other plants, with which the
     plants compete for light.

     <p>Certain aspects of phytochrome-mediated development
     outside of flowering plants are strikingly similar to those that have been characterized in
     Arabidopsis thaliana and other angiosperms. However, early diverging land plants have fewer
     distinct phyto- chrome gene lineages, suggesting that both diversification and
     subfunctionalization have been important in the evolution of the phytochrome gene family. There
     is evidence that subfunctionalization proceeded by the partitioning among paralogues of
     photosensory specificity, physiological response modes, and light-regulated gene expression and
       protein stability.

      <p>Parallel events of duplication and functional divergence may have coincided
     with the evolution of canopy shade and the increasing complexity of the light
     environment. Within angiosperms, patterns of functional divergence are clade-specific and the
     roles of phyto- chromes in A. thaliana change across environments, attesting to the
     evolutionary flexibility and contemporaneous plasticity of phytochrome signalling in the
     control of development.

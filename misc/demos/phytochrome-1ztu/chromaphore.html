  <h4> biliverdin in human bruising</h4>
  
  The heme portion (porphyrin ring) of hemoglobin breaks down into
  biliverdin (which is green),which breaks down into unconjugated
  bilirubin (which is yellow)

Chromophore-binding pocketThe unique photochromicity of phytochromes
results from keyinteractions between the bilin and its binding
pocket1,6,22. Biliverdinslides into a crevice formed betweena6 anda7
on one side and theGAFb-sheet on the other, largely burying the
extended bilin withinthe protein (Figs 1b, 3c and 4a). The PAS domain
and upstream sequence provide little direct contact except for
residues immediatelysurrounding the ligating Cys 24.

  Consistent with previous binding studies with bilin analogues
inplant phytochromes25, the propionic-acid side chains of the B and
Crings are particularly important for positioning biliverdin. These
sidechains penetrate deeply within the cleft betweena7 andb-strands
9and 10, and are fixed by highly conserved charge interactions,
directand water-mediated hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic
interactions(Fig. 3c). In particular, the carbonyl oxygens of the
B-ring propionateform salt bridges with the amines of Arg 254 and form
hydrogenbonds with the hydroxyl group of Tyr 216 and main-chain
nitrogenof Ser 257, whereas the C-ring propionate oxygens
hydrogen-bond toHis 260 and the hydroxyl groups of Ser 272 and Ser
274. A watermolecule (Wat 18) forms a water-mediated bridge between
theC-ring propionate and His 290. There are also van der
Waalsinteractions between Ile 29 and the aliphatic carbons of the
B-ringpropionate

Other interactions contribute to biliverdin orientation in
thepocket. Asp 207, Ile 208 and Pro 209 (the DIP motif) create a
kinkin the polypeptide chain betweenb8 anda6, allowing these
residuesaccess to the chromophore (Fig. 3c). The side chain of Asp 207
formsa hydrogen bond with its own main-chain nitrogen to stabilize
thisproline-induced kink, and forms a bifurcated hydrogen bond to
thenitrogens of the A and B rings. There are hydrophobic
interactionsbetween Ile 208 and the C ring, between Pro 209 and the
C10 carbonthat links the B and C rings and between Pro 209 and the B
ring.His 260, which was previously shown to be critical for
biliverdinconjugation toDrBphP4,5, forms hydrogen bonds with the
pyrrolenitrogens of rings B and C and its planar shape helps to fill a
van der Waals sandwich between these planar rings and Leu 264. Wat
12mediates a remarkable hydrogen-bonding network from His 260Nd1to the
pyrrole nitrogens of biliverdin rings A, B and C (Fig. 3c).During
phototransformation from Pr to Pfr, a substantial re-orientation of
ring D is expected22,26. A notable feature in our modelofDrCBD is the
relatively sparse packing of side chains around the Dring to allow
this rotation. Hydrophobic residues Met 174, Val 186and Leu 286 line
the pocket but are not tightly packed against the Dring. The main
contacts to the D ring are polar on one edge (ahydrogen bond from the
ring carbonyl to His 290N12) and hydro-phobic on the other (Tyr 176,
Tyr 263, Phe 198 and Phe 203) (Fig. 3b).Although Tyr 176 is buried
under the chromophore in our Prstructure, the latter three aromatic
residues are partially solvent-exposed, and the phenylalanine side
chains contact the D-ring vinylgroup

<h4> Insights into the Pr to Pfr photochemistry</h4>

The crystal structure ofDrCBD provides insight into the
uniquered/far-red photochromicity of phytochromes. There is
generalagreement, based on spectroscopic results, that
phototransformationto Pfr in plant and bacterial phytochromes involves
a 15Zantito15Eantiisomerization of the C15¼16 double bond
(Fig. 3a)20,22,27,28.Space around the D ring would allow rotation
relative to the otherpyrrole rings during the Pr to Pfr
phototransformation with minimalinterference from amino acids lining
the pocket and only the clash ofeclipsing methyl carbons from the C
and D rings of the chromophorelimiting rotation angle in either
direction (Fig. 3c). Pre-existingtorsional strain on the Pr D ring may
serve to reduce the activationenergy for rotation. The C15¼C16
isomerization would dissolve the interaction of the D ring with its Pr
bonding partner His 290 andmight perturb Phe 198 and Phe 203 by
removing favourable van derWaals interactions.In addition to rapid
isomerization of the C15¼C16 bond, asubset of published experiments
have predicted a torsion anglerotation from the 15Eantito the
15Esynconfiguration at theC14–C15 bond20,22,27,28. However, recent
elegant studies with chemi-cally locked biliverdin analogues
demonstrated that the locked15Eanticonformer of biliverdin covalently
associates with a bacterialphytochrome and exhibits spectral
properties similar to the Pfrform28. If this further 15Eantito
15Esynmovement does occur, itwould cause a steric clash between the D
ring and Tyr 176 (if therotation is away from the solvent) or Tyr 263
(if the rotation istowards the solvent). A continued rotation to the
15Esynpositioncould also lead to a clash with the side chain of Asp
207 (Fig. 3c).The rotation(s) of biliverdin lead to a partial
decoupling of thepconjugation system and a red-shift in the absorption
spectrum ofphytochrome that is characteristic of the Pfr
conformer29. Presum-ably, such movement(s) induce additional
conformational changesin the polypeptide to generate the distinctive
shape of the Pfrconformer, which for many fungal and prokaryotic
phytochromesaffects the activity of an appended kinase domain1,4. For
plantphytochromes Pfr formation exposes a nuclear localization
signalin a downstream PAS-related domain30or uncovers
interactionmotifs for downstream effectors31.It is also possible that
C15¼C16 bond isomerization could lead toperturbation of the
solvent-exposed Phe side chains and that furthertorsion about C14–C15
could push Asp 207 and initiate local melting of the DIP motif on the
surface of the CBD. Either of these would leadto a change in the shape
and properties of the invariant surface patchat the
chromophore-binding site (Fig. 4a). A final intriguing possi-bility is
that even slight shifts of the orientation of B and C ringswithin the
pocket as a consequence of D-ring movement andpostulated pocket
structure changes could release the propionateside chains from their
electrostatic interactions. This release couldbreak the structural
bridge connecting the GAF and PAS domainsand thereby free the PAS
domain for signal transmission (Fig. 2a).Clearly, determining the
structure of the Pfr form of CBD and ofDrBphP with an intact PHYdomain
downstream of the CBD will beessential to further understanding
phototransformation and signaltransduction by phytochromes, given the
importance of the PHYdomain to the establishment and maintenance of
Pfr.

<h4> Functional and evolutionary implications</h4>

An important feature of theDrCBD structure with respect to the restof
the phytochrome superfamily is the high degree of conservation4,32of
essential residues that form the PAS and GAF domains, bind thebilin,
and create the trefoil knot (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 2).Specific
examples include the Asp-Ile-Pro (DIP) motif at the bilin-binding
pocket, polar residues that interact with biliverdin propionic-acid
groups (Arg 254, Ser 272 and Ser 274), bulkyhydrophobicresidues that
line the D-ring cavity (Phe 198, Phe 203, Tyr 176 andTyr 263), and
residues that form the hydrophobic core of the trefoilknot (Ile 35,
Leu 41, Leu 241 and Leu 253). For example, recent workhas highlighted
the importance of Tyr 176 in the photochemistry ofSynechocystisCph1 by
showing that a His substitution at this position destabilizes Pfr and
creates a red fluorophore33. Consequently,we expect that our structure
of this bacterial phytochrome will behighly relevant to most, if not
all, members of the phytochromesuperfamily.Conservation of residues
surrounding the knot, including theinvariant presence of the lasso
loop within the GAF domain, indicatesthat this unique topology is
common to all red/far-red photochromicphytochromes. In fact, only the
loosely defined collection of bacterialphytochrome-like proteins may
lack this fold, an idea based onsequence alignments that show that
this group lacks both the PASdomain and the GAF loop4. Although
several members ofthis phytochrome-like group bind bilinsin
vitro(RcaE, CikA andTaxD1/PixJ1)34–36the resulting holoproteins are
not red/far-redphotoreversible, suggesting that the knot is required
for thisspectral characteristic. Within the holoprotein, the knot
mayhave several functions. One may be to stabilize contacts betweenthe
PAS and GAF domains. Another may be to limit the flexibilityof a
photoreceptor as a mechanism to prevent undesirable energylosses due
to vibration or large domain movement upon photo-isomerization of
biliverdin. Finally, by severely restricting movementof the N-terminal
domain, the knot may orient Cys 24 for efficientconjugation to
biliverdin.

<p>

  How do phytochromes fold into this convoluted tertiary structure?We
  propose a simple co-translational mechanism in which thePAS domain
  folds first, leaving the N-terminal 35 amino acids unstructured and
  Ile 35 solvent-exposed. As translation continues,the first half of
  the GAF domain, comprising thea4–a5 helicalhairpin, theb6,b7,b8
  half-sheet anda6, is translated and adopts itssecondary structure.b9
  is synthesized, followed by the lasso loop.The exposed hydrophobic
  side chains within the lasso collapsearound Ile 35 to form the
  compact knot core. Finally, the secondhalf of the GAF domain is
  translated. Although the internal sym-metry of the GAF domain is
  interrupted by the lasso (Fig. 1a, c), thefirst and lastb-strands
  cannot zip together in the centre of the sheetuntil translation is
  complete.With respect to the evolution of this photoreceptor class,
  ourmodel may explain in molecular terms how phytochromes changedfrom
  proteobacterial photoreceptors using biliverdin as the chromo-phore
  to those present today in cyanobacteria and plants that usethe more
  reduced bilins, PCB and PFB, respectively (Fig. 3a)1,26.Presumably,
  these blue-shifted bilins offer an adaptive advantage forsensing
  photosynthetic competition by closely matching the absorp-tion
  spectrum of chlorophyll3,4. This switch required evolution
  ofmechanisms to synthesize reduced bilins and to discriminate
  themfrom biliverdin in the lyase active site
  (Fig. 3a). Cyanobacterial andplant phytochromes use a cysteine in
  the GAF domain to bind theA-ring C3 ethylidene side chain of
  PCB/PFB37,38, as opposed to theproteobacterial and (probably) fungal
  phytochromes that use acysteine upstream of the PAS domain to bind
  the C3 vinyl sidechain of biliverdin4,11,32. Remarkably, modelling
  of this GAF cysteine into its comparable position (Met259) inDrCBD
  reveals that itwould extend towards the C3 side chain, as does Cys24
  inDrCBD,but from the opposite side of the chromophore
  (Fig. 4b). With noadjustment to the surrounding structure, the
  sulphur atom of acysteine replacement at position 259 would be 5.8 A
  ̊from the Cys 24sulphur and only 3.2 A ̊from the target C31carbon of
  the bilin.Consequently, evolutionary transformation of the bilin
  attachmentsite could occur without structural changes, simply by
  acquiringa cysteine at the appropriate position in the GAF
  domain. Insupport, ref. 32 recently showed that anAgrobacterium
  tumefaciensBphP1 (Agp1) variant in which the distal cysteine was
  added(Val249!Cys) preferentially assembles with PCB versus
  biliverdinto generate a photochromic phytochrome with typical
  red/far-redabsorption spectra.The structure of the bilin-binding
  domain of DrBphP yieldsthe first three-dimensional insights into the
  photochemistry andevolution of the phytochrome superfamily. This
  structure providesmolecular explanations for the known
  physico-chemical features ofphytochromes, for Pr to Pfr
  photoconversion events that initiateresponses of behavioural and
  agricultural significance, and for theevolution of the phytochrome
  family.
